// You need to build a large, filterable, and real-time data grid for a financial analytics dashboard.
// Requirements:
// The grid must handle 50k+ rows (users should still have smooth scrolling).
// Support server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting (sync with query params).
// Enable column resizing and hiding (persist user preferences).
// Handle real-time updates via WebSocket without reloading the whole grid.
// Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers).
